## 🚀 Quick Start (3 Steps)

### Step 1: Install Dependencies

```bash
cd ~/vrt-circleci-demo
./quick-start.sh
```

This script will:
- Create Python virtual environment
- Install Flask and dependencies
- Install Playwright and browsers
- Set up everything automatically

**Expected time:** 2-3 minutes

### Step 2: Start the Application

```bash
# Activate virtual environment
cd ~/vrt-circleci-demo
source venv/bin/activate

# Start Flask app
python app/app.py
```

**Visit in your browser:**
- Homepage: http://localhost:5000/
- Dashboard: http://localhost:5000/dashboard
- Profile: http://localhost:5000/profile

**You should see beautiful, styled pages!** 🎨

### Step 3: Run Visual Tests

In a **new terminal window**:

```bash
cd ~/vrt-circleci-demo
source venv/bin/activate

# Generate baseline screenshots (first time)
npm run update-snapshots

# Run visual regression tests
npm test

# View the HTML report
npm run report
```

**Expected output:**
```
✓ 16 visual regression tests passed!
```

```

### Step 2: Create GitHub Repository

**Via GitHub Website:**
1. Go to https://github.com/new
2. Repository name: `vrt-circleci-demo`
3. Description: "Visual Regression Testing Demo with CircleCI"
4. Keep it Public
5. **Don't** initialize with README
6. Click "Create repository"

### Step 3: Push to GitHub

```bash
# Add remote (replace YOUR_USERNAME)
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/vrt-circleci-demo.git

# Push
git push -u origin main
```

### Step 4: Connect CircleCI

1. Go to https://circleci.com/
2. Sign in with GitHub
3. Click "Projects"
4. Find `vrt-circleci-demo`
5. Click "Set Up Project"
6. Click "Start Building"

### Step 5: View Screenshots in CircleCI! 📸

After the pipeline runs:

1. Go to CircleCI dashboard
2. Click on your pipeline
3. Click on `visual-regression-test` job
4. **Click "ARTIFACTS" tab** ⭐
5. **Click on any screenshot to view it!**

You'll see:
```
📁 screenshots/
  ├── homepage/     ← Click to view homepage screenshots
  ├── dashboard/    ← Click to view dashboard screenshots
  └── profile/      ← Click to view profile screenshots
📊 playwright-report/  ← Full HTML test report
```

## 🎨 Test the VRT System

Let's verify it catches visual changes!

### Make a Visual Change

```bash
# Change the primary color from purple to red
sed -i '' 's/#667eea/#ff0000/g' app/static/css/styles.css
```

### Run Tests Again

```bash
npm test
```

**Expected result:** Tests FAIL! ❌

Playwright detected the color change!

### View the Diff

```bash
npm run report
```

You'll see:
- **Expected:** Purple buttons/gradients
- **Actual:** Red buttons/gradients
- **Diff:** Highlighted changes

### Accept or Reject

**To accept the change (update baselines):**
```bash
npm run update-snapshots
```

**To reject the change (revert):**
```bash
git restore app/static/css/styles.css
```

## 🎯 Success Checklist

Mark off as you complete each step:

- [ ] Project created in `~/vrt-circleci-demo`
- [ ] Dependencies installed (`./quick-start.sh`)
- [ ] Flask app runs (http://localhost:5000)
- [ ] Baseline screenshots generated
- [ ] VRT tests pass locally
- [ ] Git repository initialized
- [ ] Pushed to GitHub
- [ ] CircleCI connected
- [ ] Pipeline runs successfully
- [ ] Screenshots visible in CircleCI Artifacts

---

## 💡 Pro Tips

### 1. Always Commit Baselines
Baseline screenshots should be in version control so everyone has the same reference.

### 2. Review Diffs Carefully
Not all visual changes are bugs - some are intentional improvements.

### 3. Test Multiple Browsers
What looks good in Chrome might break in Firefox.

### 4. Wait for Animations
Add `waitForTimeout` before screenshots to let animations finish.

### 5. Use Artifacts
CircleCI artifacts are permanent - use them for historical comparison.

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Flask app won't start
```bash
# Kill any process on port 5000
lsof -ti:5000 | xargs kill -9
```

### Tests fail immediately
```bash
# Make sure Flask isn't already running
# Regenerate baselines
npm run update-snapshots
```

### Can't see artifacts in CircleCI
- Wait for job to complete
- Check "Artifacts" tab (not "Test Results")
- Verify pipeline didn't fail before artifact upload

### Playwright browsers not found
```bash
# Reinstall browsers
npx playwright install --force
```
