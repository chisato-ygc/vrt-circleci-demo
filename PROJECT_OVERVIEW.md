# 🎨 VRT CircleCI Demo - Project Overview

## 📋 Project Summary

**Project Name:** Visual Regression Testing with CircleCI  
**Purpose:** Learn and demonstrate Visual Regression Testing with CircleCI artifact visualization  
**Created:** October 2025  
**Technology Stack:** Flask (Python), Playwright (Node.js), CircleCI

---

## 🎯 What This Project Does

This project demonstrates:

1. **Visual Regression Testing (VRT)** - Automatically detect visual changes in web applications
2. **CircleCI Integration** - Run VRT tests in CI/CD pipeline
3. **Artifact Visualization** - View screenshots directly in CircleCI UI
4. **Modern Web Development** - Build beautiful web apps with Flask

### Real-World Use Case

Imagine you're working on a website. Someone makes a change that accidentally:
- Moves a button off-screen
- Changes the wrong color
- Breaks the mobile layout
- Causes text to overlap

**Visual Regression Testing catches these issues automatically!** 📸

## 🚀 How It Works

### Development Workflow

```
1. Developer writes code
   ↓
2. Makes visual changes (CSS, HTML)
   ↓
3. Runs VRT tests locally
   ↓
4. Reviews visual diffs
   ↓
5. Accepts or rejects changes
   ↓
6. Commits and pushes to GitHub
   ↓
7. CircleCI automatically runs tests
   ↓
8. Screenshots uploaded as artifacts
   ↓
9. Team reviews in CircleCI UI
```

### CircleCI Artifact Flow

```
CircleCI Job Runs
   ↓
Takes Screenshots
   ↓
Compares with Baselines
   ↓
Generates Diff Images
   ↓
Stores Everything as Artifacts
   ↓
YOU VIEW IN CIRCLECI UI! 📸
```

## 🔄 Development Lifecycle

### Phase 1: Local Development
```bash
# Start app
python app/app.py

# Make changes
# Edit app/templates/*.html or app/static/css/styles.css

# Run tests
npm test

# Review results
npm run report
```

### Phase 2: Accept Changes
```bash
# Update baselines (if changes are intentional)
npm run update-snapshots

# Commit
git add .
git commit -m "Update: Changed button color from blue to green"
```

### Phase 3: CI/CD
```bash
# Push to GitHub
git push origin main

# CircleCI automatically:
# 1. Runs all tests
# 2. Takes screenshots
# 3. Compares with baselines
# 4. Uploads artifacts
# 5. Shows results in UI
```

### Phase 4: Review
```
Visit CircleCI → Your Pipeline → Artifacts Tab
View all screenshots and diffs
Approve or reject the changes
```

git add tests/visual/
git commit -m "Update VRT baselines for new design"
git push
```

### Adding New Pages
1. Create new HTML template in `app/templates/`
2. Add route in `app/app.py`
3. Create new test file in `tests/visual/`
4. Generate baselines
5. Update documentation

### Updating Dependencies
```bash
# Python
pip install --upgrade Flask
pip freeze > requirements.txt

# Node.js
npm update
```
